# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **A Curated List of Useful Checklists**! 🎉  
This project is a curated list of helpful checklists: your help makes it better for everyone.

## 📌 What You Can Do

- 🆕 Add a new checklist (productivity, travel, health, etc).
- 📝 Fix typos, improve formatting or readability.
- 🧹 Remove broken or low-quality checklists.
- 📦 Organize checklists into appropriate categories.
- 🐛 Report issues (e.g. duplicates).

## ✅ How to Add a Checklist

Open a pull request or an issue with your change. Keep it minimal and focused.

1. Make sure the checklist is:
    - Clear, useful, and easy to follow
    - Broken down into simple steps (e.g. “Record a video” can become “Set the camera right”, “Stand in the center of the frame”, and so on)
    - Written in English (for now)
2. Use subtasks if necessary (for example, "Write Article" can have “Title”, “Small Article Preview”, “Headings”, and so on as subtasks)
3. Add it to the correct folder (or create a new folder) in the repository
4. Use [this file](./Development/GitHub_Repository_Setup_Checklist.md) as a template

## 🛠️ Technical Guidelines

- Only one checklist per file.
- Avoid duplicates.
- Keep descriptions short and to the point.
- Don’t create new folders unless needed.
- Don't add spaces to the file or folder name: use underscores instead!
- Add a "Return to the main file" link
- Add the new checklist in the main [README.md](README.md) file
